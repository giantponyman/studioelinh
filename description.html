        “Can a listener feel that they have any dignity when the values of music
        are registered against “ideals”? After all, the work and the joy of
        listening are in the internal refraction between what is and what is
        imagined. And there ain’t no respect in a prefigured imaginary.”
      </p>

        Working together, our senses and imagination massage sound into coherent
        forms. In this poem, we meet two voices, two streams of language,
        triangulated by some distant point beyond the misty horizon.

        Or it could be a model of transduction, in which an aesthetic experience
        is converted simultaneously into language and sound, which in turn
        generates new aesthetic experiences for the audience. This situation is
        enriched when a second narrator joins. Two instances of transduction
        bring the audience deeper into the fold, forcing new questions upon
        their ears… Suddenly there is a voice that verifies the other—yet it
        forks away, adhering to different rhythms, revealing and further
        obscuring the contours of a space no longer present. When two people
        speak, and a third listens to their accounts, a question emerges in
        finer detail: how is it that we hear, and what is it that we hear, when
        we listen closely with something or someone?
