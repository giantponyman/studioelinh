        “The sound of a car door slamming was not a sound. It was the sound of a
        car door slamming, and once you accepted this, you had to ask: Whose
        car? What kind of car? Where is this car? What color is the car?”
      </p>
      <p><i>- Jim O’Rourke, speaking of Luc Ferrari </i></p>
      <p>
        <i>Road Sounds</i> began as a “sonic ethnography” of transportation
        infrastructure in New England. Here it takes a different form. I think
        of this as my road journal, an impressionistic register of speed as
        formalized in material and ideological technologies of transportation.
