<p>A small purring
confused with the
air outside,
given away by its
regular rhythm,
whittling away at
the sign of life.
Saturated
air, crosshatched by domestic
drips and substrata.
The door slicing through this medium, language
and measures of distance
seeping in before
the sluice gate creeks shut.
A melodious dim chord, quaking impacts.
The chord, suffering through
planes and airs, each
taking their tribute.
Cyclic metallic raps 
duet with the leak in the sink.
Quacking, through the windows; metonym for the anarchic quiet outside.

<p>A high uneven whirring and a tumultuous growl resides behind. Mixed with almost a cranking. The first floating to the left, very quietly. Mild friction crunches between the hands and the book on the desk. The whirring persists as does the quiet digestive growl. From this slate a machine carves a chord, beginning with a small click and establishing itself. First the low dimensions, which then massage out a hovering whine. This whine oscillates between something sine-ish and a slightly more complex harmonic tone. The sine wave disappears and then emerges periodically-- proportionate to a wave lapping the shore. There are the edges of breath just in front. Two small drips round off in the distance. The windows are silent and bright. Minor tremors emerge from the phone in my hands on the book, coordinating with cognitive activity. Crack in the bone in the wrist. The sine wave laps. The chord continues furtively. It has drowned the growl and the whirring now beyond the pale of audibility. A scratchy nasal inhale and warm sigh. Two minor chirps filtered by glass. Creaking friction between the jacket underneath and the weight of the body adjusting itself. Low muffled fart. Tremors continue near the hand. The sine-ish wave changes in character when it reaches its apex, warbling slightly.
