		<li><b>Big Honk (ii)</b></li>
	</ul>
<p>
Gather any number of cars in a suitably large space. For the duration of the piece, beginning with a single horn, each driver should honk their horn in long plateus of sound, so as to generate an overlapping and continuous medium. The carsâ€™ engines should be off, unless moving to another location in the space. Open duration.

<ul class="heading">
		<li><b>Hourglass</b> (for Maya)</li>
		<li>for a finite amount of sand and any number of people</li>
	</ul>
<p>
Take the sand in your hands or some other vessel and let it slip through your grasp.

Let it go in torrents or trickles. Let it fall from a height or from very near to the ground. Let it fall on planes and inclines; inside, outside, and onto objects; into piles and drifts and empty spaces.
</p>

<ul class="heading">
		<li><b>Platform</b></li>
		<li>For two or more people, open instrumentation</li>
	</ul>
<p>
When the train door closes and as the train begins to accelerate, open and sustain a long tone. Your sound should be soft but present. As the next train arrives and its doors open, conclude your tone. Repeat.
