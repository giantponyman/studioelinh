	<p style="font-family:serif;">Eli Neuman-Hammond (b.1995) is an artist based in Providence, RI. He works with sound, images, objects, and conversation to explore intimate, disavowed, and persistent relations between the past and present. His work interrogates how people and spaces are receptive (and antagonistic) to particular histories by amplifying and removing sonic material that's already present and intervening with additional sound. Using unconventional, simple, and exacting speaker arrangements, recent work subverts a naturalized technological order in which microphones are believed to capture "fields" of sound which can be neutrally reamplified in other times and spaces. Eli borrows techniques from oral history to express the possibilities and limits of memory and transmission. His practice engages listening as an exercise of labor, pleasure, alienation, and play, out of which new ethics can emerge in relation to specific sites, objects, and people.
