	<p style="font-family:serif;">Eli Neuman-Hammond (he/him, b.1995) is an artist based in Providence, RI. He uses  sound, images, and objects to explore intimate, disavowed, and persistent relations between present and past. His work interrogates how people and spaces are receptive (and antagonistic) to particular histories by amplifying and removing material that's present and intervening with additional materials. He engages listening–and perception more broadly–as an exercise of labor, pleasure, alienation, and play, out of which new ethics can emerge in relation to specific sites, objects, and people. There are stakes to when and how one listens. He borrows strategies from oral history to express the possibilities and limits of transmission and memory, and he uses simple speaker arrangements to subvert a naturalized technological order in which microphones are believed to neutrally capture "fields" of sound. Eli also makes landscape paintings.
