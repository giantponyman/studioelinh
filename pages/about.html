	<p style="font-family:serif;"> Eli Neuman-Hammond lives and works in Providence, RI. He employs a variety of materials to raise the stakes of when and how we give attention, especially within landscapes. His sound work strategically amplifies, attenuates, filters, and resonates material to highlight listenersâ€™ already-present attentions and inattentions. Recent paintings address the romantic American visual regime. His music has been published by edition wandelweiser and El Gallo de Oro (forthcoming), and he has performed at DIY venues throughout the US. He teaches at MassArt.
