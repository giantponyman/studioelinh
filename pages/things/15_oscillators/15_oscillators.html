<h2>Music for 15 Oscillators (2020)</h2>
<p>
I wanted to gather frequencies, like stones or flowers or snippets of conversation. I wanted tonal slabs like haikus, whose syllables were sine waves.
<p>
The principle here is topographical; layers accrete like sediment and then wash away. The music only uses time as an archaeological tool: it reveals the composition of a particular, pseudo-artificial space, through which one can move at their own pace.
<p>
The performer is only concerned with presence: <i>is the frequency in the space, is it coming into the space, or is it leaving the space? </i> Any sense of motion arises out of intervallic relationships, the performance space, and the audience’s position and choices, which generate various splinters and distortions of the “ideal” waveforms.
<p>
I don’t think there is anything transcendental about the drone, even though it just goes ON and ON... The drone is a mad engineer of affect, crafting lateral byways, always moving between listeners like “like grass between the paving stones.” The drone isn’t necessarily hypnotic or cleansing; its best use is not in replicating affects, but as a tool for their devious proliferation. 
<p>
So here partials stack up until there is a complex spatial and psychoacoustic modulation matrix, and then each tone slowly takes its leave. There are many paths into and out of the piece, and its apparent destination recedes in exact proportion to one’s proximity to it. As usual, the territory exceeds the map.
