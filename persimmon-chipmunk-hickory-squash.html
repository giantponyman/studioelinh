      <p>Persimmon, chipmunk, hickory, squash, moose, opossum, caribou.</p>

      <p>
        Words taken from Algonquian languages populate the vernacular of the
        American landscape. They condition the designatory and descriptive
        capacity of American English in relation to the environs which it came
        to dominate as the lingua franca of enclosure. Words like these, of
        flora and fauna, bear a more complete assimilation than the Native words
        and names typically reserved for street signs, cities, states, and
        infrastructure. Those are different kinds of landscape words. Taconic,
        Seekonk, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and the like.

        Here, there are persimmons, chipmunks, hickory, squash, moose, opossum,
        and caribou: both vegetation and animal. But these rest on the strata of
        minerals beneath our feet. Rocks crushed, overturned, buried deep, and
        fortified. Their names mean obduracy. Yet, as architecture, comprising
        buildings and walls, they enunciate the enduring but fragile physicality
        of property relations. The divergence between land and its
        overdetermination by capital expands in this interplay between figure
        and ground.
