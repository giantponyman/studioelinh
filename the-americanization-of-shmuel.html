      <h2>The Americanization of Shmuel</h2>
      <img class="documentation" src="images/taos-01a.jpg" alt="Your Image Description" />
 <blockquote>
         "The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make
              whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise;
              it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel
              can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into
              the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris
              before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call
              progress." 
              <p>-Walter Benjamin, 1940
 </blockquote>
  
        <p>
          <strong>The Americanization of Shmuel </strong>is a polyphonic, multilingual map of songs, places, movements, and
            assimilation. There are recorded fragments, flotsam and debris left
            in the angel of history&lsquo;s turbid wake. And then there is the
            noise, an implacable wind, an inverted floor, at times the tide, a
            valley, snow, sleep&ndash;and always a screen, which both masks and
            becomes a surface of projection. The wind ebbs and flows, eroding
            syllables and dividing the piece into 18 parts &ndash;
            numerologically the Hebrew word</span
          ><strong> חי </strong>or "life", made up of the letters Chet (ח) and Yud (י).</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 400"
            >There are three narratives that weave through the piece. The first
            to appear concerns an intergenerational family. They sing and listen
            together, trying to remember lullabies. Some of these songs have
            been reproduced through generations of singing, some of them are
            lost, or teetering on the edge of memory. They sing and speak a
            variety of languages &ndash; Italian, Spanish, Yiddish, English,
            Arabic, Hebrew. In the second narrative a piano melody undergoes
            transformations and permutations. The melody was arranged and
            popularized by Jazz pianist Bill Evans, but originally written for
            the 1964 anti-war comedy "The Americanization of Emily."
            These recordings are made in an artist's studio, where you can
            hear the artist manipulating a computer that processes and
            "mis-remembers" the melody using a simple markov chain
            patch.The third narrative is about an old man, Sam or
            "Shmuel." He speaks English with a thick accent and recollects
            moments in his life from before and after World War II. In 1944, he
            and his family were deported from the Carpathian mountains to the
            concentration camp Auschwitz. Only Sam and one brother managed to
            escape in 1945. After being mistakenly taken as prisoners of war by
            the Soviet army they returned to their village in the mountains,
            which was unrecognizable, and then smuggled themselves into
            mandatory Palestine via Britain's Jewish Brigade, before
            eventually immigrating to Barranquilla, Colombia, then to Newark,
            New Jersey, and finally to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he has lived
            most of his life in diaspora and where he raised his three
            daughters, one of which is the artist's mother.

          <strong>But a storm is blowing from Paradise</strong
          ><span style="font-weight: 400">
            is saxophonist Ella Heron&rsquo;s melodic response to the embedded
            histories of the A side. It is a prayer to the Last Angel of History
            recorded in wind and metal.</span

            >The theme common to both sides of the record is how private
            cultures of transmission resist nationalistic monopolies on space,
            narrative, and history.</span
