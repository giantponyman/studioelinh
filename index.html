        I use a variety of materials to raise the stakes of when and how we give
        attention, especially within landscapes. My sound work strategically
        amplifies, attenuates, filters, and resonates material to highlight
        listeners’ already-present attentions and inattentions. I've published
        music on edition wandelweiser, and/OAR, and El Gallo de Oro
        (forthcoming), and I've performed at DIY venues throughout the United
        States. I live and work in Providence, RI, and I teach at MassArt in
        Boston.

        <p>Persimmon, chipmunk, hickory, squash, moose, opossum, caribou.</p>

        <p>
          Words taken from Algonquian languages populate the vernacular of the
          American landscape. They condition the designatory and descriptive
          capacity of American English in relation to the environs which it came
          to dominate as the lingua franca of enclosure. Words like these, of
          flora and fauna, bear a more complete assimilation than the Native
          words and names typically reserved for street signs, cities, states,
          and infrastructure. Those are different kinds of landscape words.
          Taconic, Seekonk, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, there are persimmons, chipmunks, hickory, squash, moose,
          opossum, and caribou: both vegetation and animal. But these rest on
          the strata of minerals beneath our feet. Rocks crushed, overturned,
          buried deep, and fortified. Their names mean obduracy. Yet, as
          architecture, comprising buildings and walls, they enunciate the
          enduring but fragile physicality of property relations. The divergence
          between land and its overdetermination by capital expands in this
          interplay between figure and ground.

          "I recognize the mountains." is on the one hand a version of the
          <i>sh'ma</i> and on the other hand an impressionistic portrait of two
          voices marked by the twentieth century. It queries the possibilities
          and limits of transmission, taking place within an envelope of
          possibility opened up through the passing of time, physical distance,
          and intergenerational encounter.

        <p>
          Stones, "fields," street signs, bricks, and textual remnants animate
          these paintings. Throughout New England, colonial practices have
          scarred the land in ways integrated and obscured by the romantic
          American visual regime. Fieldstone walls, for example, are a byproduct
          of colonial agriculture and property law. When colonists encroached on
          native land and cleared fields for English-style agriculture and
          settlement, stone walls accumulated at their margins. Each winter,
          water penetrated the loosened earth and froze, heaving new stones to
          the surface, so that the fields needed to be cleared perpetually.
          These stones, lifted against gravity, remain on the surface,
          patterning the landscape with romanticized indices of labor and the
          slow violence of colonial agriculture. Empty fields rhyme with empty
          green highway signs, which around here are so often marked with
          transliterated Algonquian words.

        <p>
          “Carnival’s Quarrel with Lent '' was written for the slide whistle, a
          comic instrument that’s easy to play and well-suited for an ironic
          critique of chamber music. Four sequential pieces are recorded
          idiosyncratically to reflect different conceptual aims and changing
          socio-economic conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I revive a jongleur figure in the opening and closing sections of the
          record, which take place in the skeletal remains of a public sphere.
          In these parts I execute a long glissando without blowing air into the
          whistle. (The music is constructed with the ambient energy resonating
          within the whistle’s expanding and contracting column of air.) Site is
          central to these recordings. I realized the first section on a street
          corner in Queens, NY, as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic ebbed
          in June 2020. The whistle amplifies fireworks, near and far; passing
          cars and mobile sound systems; the rustling of foliage; and an
          expectant tension redolent with joy and fear. The companion glissando
          was recorded November 7 in Washington Square Park, just after the 2020
          presidential election. The dominant sound here is noise, which pulls
          the glissando into sharper relief. There is a massive cacophony of
          voices, tenuously coincident in celebratory articulation in spite of
          vastly different interests and experiences. While the glissando lends
          a rising motion to the first piece, it falls here, deflating like a
          balloon and capturing my own ambivalent identification with the
          chaotic, jubilant affect that saturates the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filtration is an ambivalent process in sound. A filter emphasizes
          particular frequencies, pulling these into the foreground, but
          filtration can also be considered in terms of attenuation. A filtering
          out. This elliptical quality of filters, in which negative space
          highlights the contours of a lens as much as the subject brought into
          focus, generates a multiplicity of meanings. These pieces are loosely
          inspired by an anecdote told by Akio Suzuki, in which his father plays
          a melody on the flute using only his fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the quintets, five voices converge and diverge as they sing through
          the microtonal range of the slide whistle, yielding a tapestry of
          beating tones. While each part is identical, the players proceed at
          their own pace, not unlike Morton Feldman’s “Two Pianos.” One quintet
          was recorded in spring quarantine, and the second en plein air during
          the winter.

          “To have a definite beginning and a definite, predictable end is the
          mark of fabrication, which through this characteristic alone
          distinguishes itself from all other human activities. Labor, caught in
          the cyclical movement of the body’s life process, has neither
          beginning nor an end.”<br />-Hannah Arendt, “Work” in The Human
          Condition
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a recording of me sanding down a small wooden object. This is
          only one short document of a ten-year period I spent working
          intermittently on this object- even though in musical terms,
          40-minutes might be considered a long duration. While sanding this
          piece of wood, I was thinking about "work" in Hannah Arendt's sense of
          human activity directed towards particular ends, which become concrete
          aspects of the world; i.e. tables, chairs, buildings, etc.. I was just
          mulling this over while sanding this fork, and thought that it would
          be good to record for a while, since the sounds are integral to the
          aesthetics of work, in which the mind is circumscribed briefly to a
          very small activity whose residue is a distinct form. It strikes me as
          a very musical activity, this sanding and forming. The rhythms and
          resonance of the wood, and especially the breaks in the activity,
          where I quietly (invisibly) contemplate where to sand further (towards
          an image), or leave the room to pursue some different activity.
          Overall, I began to interpret the sounds as a pretty informative or at
          least musically interesting palimpsest of this work-oriented thought,
          more accurate to its contours than the wooden object that is its
          result.

          a car door slamming, and once you accepted this, you had to ask: Whose
          car? What kind of car? Where is this car? What color is the car?”

          There’s a circumference, a median, a bridge. Before they patch up last
          winter’s potholes, they must internalize an idea of speed. Flat
          surfaces are integral to capitalism's geometry. There are parking
          lots, and there’s also the open road (an oxymoron). “Maximum
          circulation coincides with maximum control.” There are echoes, then
          inundations. The circumference falters, but expands into your
          perceptual space. You warm up, shuffling around ambience. The highway
          prefers haphazard plateaus to sleep. Distant machinations become
          intimate in the most unexpected and direct ways. The horn continues,
          you turn on the radio.

          <i>Road Sounds</i> began as a “sonic ethnography” of transportation
          infrastructure in New England. Here it takes a different form. I think
          of this as my road journal, an impressionistic register of speed as
          formalized in material and ideological technologies of transportation.
          The recordings are uncut and unprocessed. This is not to say that they
          are objective documents, only that they present durations of time,
          rather than objects of sound. These are descriptive documents, whose
          composition runs parallel to specific flows and events. There are no
          soundscapes, there is no immersion: just a few opportunities to listen
          to something.

          Then the hail came with the dark, setting up a staccato drumming on
          the corrugated metal roof.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence and the shadow hung around us. Away off in the country
          silence beyond the barracks walls there was one tiny edge of sound, a
          handsaw keening: nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
          It feels like she has had an experience of some kind, that
          something&rsquo;s got into her, making her tense on the inside like a
          string on a musical instrument, causing her to make a clean sound,
          inaudible to anyone. A quiet sound, meant just for her body -- a
          short-lived concert in a brittle acoustical shell.

          He began to rise from the toilet into something awful, into a new
          sound, into the rising decibels of the woman screaming from the living
          room.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Once it goes out of tune, </em>she thought,
          <em
            >it takes a long time to readjust the quiet to the sound of me.</em

        <p>
          Continuously, with no pause, a hissing mutter fills the air, so huge
          and so long a sound that one cannot hear it when one stops to listen;
          yet it fills all the interstices of one's being.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>A noise like sudden rain.</p>
        <p>
          Catching the Voice of America through the crackling of the jamming
          static. I still remember that beautiful crackling.

          But there was no longer any life in his belly, and his voice sounded
          thin like the creaking of ice.

        <p>the mechanical cacophony drowns out their conversation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A reverberating collision and a sea-sick feeling at once.&nbsp;</p>

          He listens intently, as though for a special sound or as though he

          the question was resonating like a profound but untimely silence that
          should be broken for the sake of politeness

        <p>A marvelous distance floods her euphoric ears</p>

          They slide up and down the stem in knots, hissing quietly, together a

          The keystone of the arch goes up past him in its sling, is raised,
          settled, and fitted almost soundlessly, great ton-weight block though
          it is, into the gap between the two piers, making them one, one thing,
          an arch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wall of a tent leans up over my face, not visible but audible, a
          slanting plane of faint sound: the susurrus of blown snow. Nothing can
          be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          the motor's roar is deafening, and yet after just a moment the brain
          grows accustomed, as it does in the winter to thick clothing that
          separates the body from the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were more than a hundred people clustered around the park
          entrance now, and they began to chatter in a rising polyphonous
          clamor.
        </p>
        <p>
          We heard at the far end of the garden, not the copious high-pitched
          bell that drenched, that deafened in passing with it's ferruginous,
          icy, inexhaustible noise any person in the household who set it off by
          coming in "without ringing," but the shy, oval, double tinkling of the
          little visitors' bell&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Their talk and laughter bounced strangely off the tiles walls, an
          insane barrage of fragmentary noises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sounds have curled up inside themselves, withdrawn their snail's eyes;
          the orchestra of the world has departed, vanishing into the
          park.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          the sound is long, mournful, like the voice of an animal. Then it
          stops, shattered into cicadas' small echoes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          the sound of the wind seems the sound of the wind that blows
          there.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the concentrated quiet, all his sense became a listening, and he, a
          moving prayer.

          A wash in the distance. It sounds like a quiet stream dancing on top
          of the river beneath it. A large brushing expands outwards from the
          green to my left. Points suddenly illuminate everything around me. I
          need to move. <br />
          <br />
          Underneath now, cascading white and translucent sheets fall
          everywhere. Except, I am distinctly below and behind, or in front of
          them. Thus their texture is available to me differently from this
          distance, or intimate shelter. Arhythmically a piece of metal sings,
          and the sheets expand into massive, soft shapes that ring out
          everywhere in a din. Muffled amplified passages occupy the stones and
          architectural copper that encloses my ears. Steadying, and unyielding.
          The noise begins to hide in the mortar of my imagination, both
          receding and seeping in everywhere. Its color is less white now,
          approaching a quiet shade of blue, or a low pellucid plane atop a
          green field. The scent of rose petals cuts through the noisy mist. The
          inflowing torrent reverberates and settles between the floor and the
          ceiling. Who knows when it will end.

          Washed out and grey hum. Breathy like an interminable exhale.
          Shuffling dots the room, "I was never here." Crackling brittle paper.
          Muted tapping on the hollow desk met with rubber. Pasted together
          formants. "What you working on?" Children in the space outside the
          room. "I was never here." Folding paper. Bang. Click, clock, stop.
          Shuffle. "More, more." "I'm tired." Hard and reflective walls cloister
          and inflame each sound. Squealing hinge echoes through the door.

          There is a space around me, and outside, through the window, as well
          as beside me in the next room over. Additionally, there are the spaces
          before, and after. A little drummer keeps time outside, as well as
          reggaeton seeping into the alleyway onto which my window opens, from
          some passing car. The drip outside taps persistently, atop a cloud of
          fledglings sparkling in a higher register. Near silent footsteps
          address the floor as Werner the cat walks through the door and onto my
          bed, where I sit. I’m reminded of the dog, Ozzie, who breathes very
          lightly behind me, occasionally wheezing and readjusting his resting
          position with a shuffle. There is a cooing morning dove, in seeming
          conversation with the white, damp sky. My roommate Malcolm issues an
          occasional sniffle, alerting me to the nature of the space outside my
          door. The drumming pattern, on some resonant surface of wood or
          plastic or metal, continues. A sweet-sounding tone arrives
          unexpectedly. At first from outside--but, no, it’s from the room
          through the door. It seems to be music, inexplicably sourced. The room
          I am in is quiet. The birds’ chatter and the dove’s lamenting song
          seem to fill the air here, from outside. The dripping water, on the
          other hand, falls clearly on the other side of the open window. At
          last I remember the pencil, scratching out on the page in the
          notebook. And the voice in my head, irrupting in silence.

          To my left, a soft, grey sound. Occasional silences, which interrupt a
          patchwork of low-fidelity recordings emitted from speakers at the
          front of the room, towards my right. Gurgling.

          a fan moves the air slightly, its inaudibility accentuating total
          motion. When the air does not impact the nerve curled inside the
          cochlea, or my bared thigh and ass, it assumes the shape of a vessel,
          flirting alternately with the walls and my skin. The winds on the
          other hand are relatively anti-social, batting my eyelids shut, piling
          on in sheets so as to obscure their provenance, bursting as they do on
          a whim when the pressure shifts, imparting little save brute direction
          and windburn.

          Crying tickling gushing undivided mass. Trinkets from some other
          place, formants made into unfamiliar patterns. Su, su. La la la la la
          blah. Occasional translations. Or breaches. Horn -sneeze- from the
          reflective basin. A mass that holds the loud and far travelling sound.
          Intimate and clumsy wind. Careless with fine frequencies, all smushed
          together until the grass tips slightly. Sniffling sniffle. Scratching.
          Somewhere at the circumference a thin border of overlapping chatter.

          The whirring, indistinct as though scratched. Suddenly a duck. Then
          another, diminished sequence. Dim through the glass. Perhaps a ripple.
          Everything a surface etched by the noise above me. Symetrical and
          warm, periodic breathing near my feet. In concert, the breath beneath
          my hands, rising and falling each voice sliced - more quacking - by
          the lateral - a gust of wind, high sheets rearranging below - woosh.
          The sticky tongue by my feet lubricates the upper end of the spectrum,
          each lick an ornament to the nearly imperceptible tumult that engulfs
          the room.

          A small purring confused with the air outside, given away by its
          regular rhythm, whittling away at the sign of life. Saturated air,
          crosshatched by domestic drips and substrata. The door slicing through
          this medium, language and measures of distance seeping in before the
          sluice gate creeks shut. A melodious dim chord, quaking impacts. The
          chord, suffering through planes and airs, each taking their tribute.
          Cyclic metallic raps duet with the leak in the sink. Quacking, through
          the windows; metonym for the anarchic quiet outside.

          A high uneven whirring and a tumultuous growl resides behind. Mixed
          with almost a cranking. The first floating to the left, very quietly.
          Mild friction crunches between the hands and the book on the desk. The
          whirring persists as does the quiet digestive growl. From this slate a
          machine carves a chord, beginning with a small click and establishing
          itself. First the low dimensions, which then massage out a hovering
          whine. This whine oscillates between something sine-ish and a slightly
          more complex harmonic tone. The sine wave disappears and then emerges
          periodically-- proportionate to a wave lapping the shore. There are
          the edges of breath just in front. Two small drips round off in the
          distance. The windows are silent and bright. Minor tremors emerge from
          the phone in my hands on the book, coordinating with cognitive
          activity. Crack in the bone in the wrist. The sine wave laps. The
          chord continues furtively. It has drowned the growl and the whirring
          now beyond the pale of audibility. A scratchy nasal inhale and warm
          sigh. Two minor chirps filtered by glass. Creaking friction between
          the jacket underneath and the weight of the body adjusting itself. Low
          muffled fart. Tremors continue near the hand. The sine-ish wave
          changes in character when it reaches its apex, warbling slightly.

          “Can a listener feel that they have any dignity when the values of
          music are registered against “ideals”? After all, the work and the joy
          of listening are in the internal refraction between what is and what
          is imagined. And there ain’t no respect in a prefigured imaginary.”

          Working together, our senses and imagination massage sound into
          coherent forms. In this poem, we meet two voices, two streams of
          language, triangulated by some distant point beyond the misty horizon.

          Or it could be a model of transduction, in which an aesthetic
          experience is converted simultaneously into language and sound, which
          in turn generates new aesthetic experiences for the audience. This
          situation is enriched when a second narrator joins. Two instances of
          transduction bring the audience deeper into the fold, forcing new
          questions upon their ears… Suddenly there is a voice that verifies the
          other—yet it forks away, adhering to different rhythms, revealing and
          further obscuring the contours of a space no longer present. When two
          people speak, and a third listens to their accounts, a question
          emerges in finer detail: how is it that we hear, and what is it that
          we hear, when we listen closely with something or someone?

          Plows and shovels move snow all winter, making inadvertent monuments
          to the cold that outlast the season and store energy for a thermal
          exchange when the right conditions are met. When it finally warms,
          quiet assemblages spring into motion for a few fleeting days, as
          snowmelt trickles down eaves, gutters, pallets, sidewalks. I made most
          of these recordings on such a day in Providence, Rhode Island, when
          most of our winter snow melted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike an urban rainstorm, whose din emerges ubiquitously, these
          trickles occur in isolated pockets. The rain cloud hovers impartially
          above the city, but ice has coordinates. It is intimate with the forms
          and surfaces of the city; it articulates the city as it melts. These
          apparently natural water sounds are thus intensely cultured; they
          emerge unexpectedly along the contours of the urban environment, which
          localize the water into many small "ensembles.”
        </p>
        <p>
          With this musically-inflected metaphor I hope to underscore how these
          recordings oscillate between musical and documentary aesthetics, a
          tension uniquely brought forth by recording technologies. As with the
          microscope, a microphone brings matter nearer to us at the same time
          as it abstracts it into artificial relations with our senses. It
          describes and it argues. Vibrations are headily amplified when they
          pass between kinetic and electric media. And yet waveforms are
          contoured by events in the world, in fact become contours of events,
          even as they fly away from them-- towards music, for instance.
